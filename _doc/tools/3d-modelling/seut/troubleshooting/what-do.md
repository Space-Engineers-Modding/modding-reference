title: There is an issue - what do I do?
---

The first step should always be to **gather more information** on exactly what went wrong. In the case of SEUT, if there is no error popup, this means **checking the** `SEUT Notifications`-screen. There you can filter all notifications by type and thus should be able to easily find errors and warnings. Errors in that screen also contain a button with a link to the list below, which provides solutions to fix all errors. Should no relevant error or warning be listed in the `SEUT Notifications`-screen, check the `Blender System Console` linked at the bottom of that screen.

If you **cannot find an answer to your issue**, or if you find something marked `Traceback` in your `Blender System Console`, your next step should be to **search through the open GitHub issues** [here](https://github.com/enenra/space-engineers-utilities/issues). If you cannot find an issue pertaining your particular case, feel free to **open up a new issue**.
