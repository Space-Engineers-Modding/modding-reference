### Export All Scenes
This button will iterate through all scenes and their collections within the `BLEND`-file and export them one by one. 

### Export Current Scene
Exports all collections within the current scene.

### Delete Temp Files
By default, the only files resulting from export are the `SBC` and `MWM` files, as all **intermediary files are automatically cleaned up**. Untoggling this option will prevent these temporary files from being cleaned up and thus allows for debugging.

### SBC
This toggle controls whether a `SBC` file is generated on export. It is enabled by default but once the initial `SBC` has been adjusted, a new export is usually not needed.

### Large
This toggle controls whether the current scene is exported to large grid.

### Small
This toggle controls whether the current scene is exported to small grid.

### Export Folder
The directory to export your model to. Must contain `Models\` in its path to be eligible. Set this to directly export into your mod's directory.

#### Copy Export Options
This button copies the current `Export Options` to all other scenes within the `BLEND`-file.
