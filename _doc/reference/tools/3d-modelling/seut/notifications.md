#### Clear Notifications
This button clears all currently stored notifications.

#### Filters
Unticking any of the notification icons will filter that type of notification out of the displayed list. Note that this doesn't clear the notifications that are hidden. Re-enabling them will restore all of them.

#### Entries
Every entry is marked with the notification type, its ID as well as a timestamp. Errors are marked in red and list a button, which will open up a page on this website that describes the cause of the error and possible fixes.

#### Toggle System Console
Should an error or issue not be listed in this screen, it might still be listed in the `Blender System Console`. This button opens it.
