| **Conveyorline In** | Conveyor connection point without direct access that only lets items pass into the block. Does not highlight anything. | Conveyor empties in a block must overlap point of origin of conveyor empty in adjacent block to connect. | 
| **Conveyorline Out** | Conveyor connection point without direct access that only lets items pass out of the block. Does not highlight anything. | Conveyor empties in a block must overlap point of origin of conveyor empty in adjacent block to connect. | 
| **Conveyorline Small In** | Conveyor connection point for small grid without direct access that only lets items pass into the block. Does not highlight anything. | Conveyor empties in a block must overlap point of origin of conveyor empty in adjacent block to connect. | 
| **Conveyorline Small Out** | Conveyor connection point for small grid without direct access that only lets items pass out of the block. Does not highlight anything. | Conveyor empties in a block must overlap point of origin of conveyor empty in adjacent block to connect. | 
| **Connector** | Adds connector functionality. |  | Cannot be placed too far from block origin or the connector will only spin grids instead of connecting.

| **Collector** | Adds collector functionality. |  | 
| **Merge Block** | Adds merge block functionality. |  | 
| **Thruster Flame** | Determines the point where the thruster flame will appear. | Empty size defines flame width. Flame length is controlled within the SBC definition. Flare will only appear on empty with lowest index. | Thrust direction is always Y-.
