This collection stores the highest-quality, fully constructed version of your model.

One thing to bear in mind, is that if you have a very large object (8+ meters in any direction) - you may observe random deformation of smooth surfaces, the investigation of why this happens is ongoing, the current workaround is to make use of custom subparts, as it seems to be origin-point based.
