title: Build Stages
---

These are the individual build stages that are shown when your block is in the construction phase. The visual appearance of the block is completely up to you, as simple or as complex as you want.

The `Wireframe` Modifier is particularly useful here, but depending on the complexity of your mesh, it may cause the polycount to skyrocket, use with care!
